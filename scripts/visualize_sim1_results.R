# Visualization plan for simulation results.
#
# Simulation 1 is performed in pixel space.
#
# For the true simulated data, we will show:
#   - Group mean difference at each pixel (heatmap)
#   - Group mean difference at each frequency (scatterplot)
#   - True coefs in pixel space (heatmap)
#   - True coefs transformed to freq space (scatterplot vs. eigenvalue order)
#
# For the fitted models, each iteration includes four models:
#   - Pixel space: fitted with lambda.min and lambda.1se
#   - Frequency space: fitted with lambda.min and lambda.1se
#
# For each model, we will generate:
#   - A heatmap of coefficients in pixel space
#   - A scatterplot of the corresponding coefficients in freq space
#   - A heatmap of p<0.05 in pixel space
#   - A scatterplot of the corresponding p<0.05 in freq space
